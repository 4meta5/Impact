somehow embedding the song in the presentation would be cool in theory

## Sally

* Sally is a **single mother of two**. 
* She was **recently promoted** at her job!
* Although the promotion increases her compensation, she works longer hours and loses benefits from welfare. 
* In fact, **her increase in pay is almost entirely offset by the loss of welfare benefits**.

```notes
- Need a picture of Sally
```

# Sally is not alone!

* 110 million Americans are receiving welfare (35%)
* Single moms represent 55% of the total welfare population
* 46.5 million people receive food stamps (15%)
* 77% of the budget is used towards basic necessities such as housing, food, and transportation

```notes
may not keep this slide...depends on length...I'd rather focus more time on *attacking* unconditional cash transfers

MAYBE the move is to split this into like 3 slides and go pretty fast, like just show how big this problem really is

# And it's only getting worse...
* The Trump budget had proposed cutting food stamps by more than 25 percent over the next ten years
  * signaled an intention and, perhaps, a shift in public attitude
* The federal government makes the benefits available but then leaves it to states to administer them.
  * A Wyoming legislator, proud of how badly he had gummed up the state’s nutrition programs, told him, “We pride ourselves on doing the minimum required by the federal government.” 
  * An Arizona congressman proposed that the card used by people receiving food-stamp benefits be made prison orange, conferring not just nutrition but shame. 
  * In 2016, after several counties in North Carolina suffered severe flooding, the state tried to distribute federal disaster-relief food-benefit cards on the day of the presidential election, to give poor people a choice between eating and voting.

> Our project strives to crowdsource financial aid for Sally to break the cycle of poverty and put her on a path towards financial independence

```notes
- Figure out how to color certain words here...this is NOT the mission statemet
```

```notes
- I think this will be 2-3 slides, but I want them to be fast
```

> The Donor Incentive Problem

* incentivizing donors is very important
* this doesn't just come down to marketing, it has more to do with the nature of the mechanism itself
* discuss in 1 sentence or less the altruistic paradox wrt homelessness
* some stats here would be useful

---

> Unconditional Cash Transfers Don't Align Incentives

* effectiveness doesn't always imply a greater donor base
* painpoints of unconditional cash transfers
* many people are looking for a more trust-free way of donating

---

# Can we uphold recipient autonomy and minimize required donor trust???

---

## Sunshine

* high level discussion of our Solution
* we need some kind of flow chart here

---

## The Team and Our Vision

* introduction to each person 
* we want this to become a self-sustaining, autonomous mechanism for donations
