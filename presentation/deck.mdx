# Sunshine

*on a cloudy day*

```notes
somehow embedding the song in the presentation would be cool in theory

> **Sally** is a single mother of two. 
* She was recently promoted at her job!
* Although the promotion increases her compensation, she works longer hours and loses benefits from welfare. 

```notes
- In fact, her increase in pay is almost entirely offset by the loss of welfare benefits
```

---

# Sally is not alone!

* 110 million Americans are receiving welfare (35%)
* Single moms represent 55% of the total welfare population
* 46.5 million people receive food stamps (15%)
* 77% of the budget is used towards basic necessities such as housing, food, and transportation

---

> Our project strives to crowdsource financial aid for Sally to break the cycle of poverty and put her on a path towards financial independence.

```notes
- Figure out how to color certain words here...this is NOT the mission statemet
```

```notes
- I think this will be 2-3 slides, but I want them to be fast
```

> Why do donors donate to certain charities?

* studies regarding effiency?
* the underlying cause?
* tax benefits?
* marketing?

---

> Unconditional Cash Transfers Don't Align Incentives

* effectiveness doesn't always imply a greater donor base
* painpoints of unconditional cash transfers
* many people are looking for a more trust-free way of donating

---

# Can we uphold recipient autonomy and minimize required donor trust???

---

## Sunshine

* high level discussion of our Solution
* we need some kind of flow chart here

---

## The Team and Our Vision

* introduction to each person 
* we want this to become a self-sustaining, autonomous mechanism for donations
