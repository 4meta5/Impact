# Impact
Universal Basic Income Solution (started for the [Impact Fellowship](https://www.impactlabs.io/fellowship))

## Our Idea (Rough)

*Donors buy goods directly for recipients.*

> Target demographic: low-income areas in the US close to Amazon shipping warehouses

By focusing on low-income areas in close proximity to Amazon shipping stations, we can ship goods directly to the people in need.

Value add(s):
* **Direct**: direct purchase alleviates the trust implicit in unconditional cash transfers, thereby providing increased confidence that the donation is used for its intended purpose
* **Convenient**: multiple models for contribution including but not limited to subscription-based donations, `rounding up`-style donations via a browser plugin, and a *pay in crypto* option
* **Reputation-Based**: [Bloom](https://bloom.co/) enables us to establish identity for recipients and develop metrics for reputation to decide on future priority   
    * recipients can fill out surveys regarding the donation that increase their reputation (surveys provide data and feedback on impact)

Categories (food, water, shelter, etc.):
* Food/Water 
* Healthcare
    * Childcare
* Clothes (think of overarching category)

Crypto Components: <br>
* 0x portal for donating with crypto
* Bloom for managing list of recipients

Open Questions:<br>
* ranking users with Bloom -- how?
* what categories?
* how do we show the impact of donations to donors? pictures, etc?

Painpoints: <br>
* sustainability (incentive to provide recurring donations)?
* disconnect between target demographic and complicated user onboarding process
    * need to verify usability of [Bloom](https://bloom.io)
* how do we measure or verify need
