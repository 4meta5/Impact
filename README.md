# Impact
Universal Basic Income Solution (started for the [Impact Fellowship](https://www.impactlabs.io/fellowship))

## Our Idea (Rough)

Target demographic: low-income areas in the US close to Amazon shipping warehouses.





Crypto Components: <br>
* 0x portal for donating with crypto
* Bloom for managing list of recipients

Open Questions:<br>
* ranking users with Bloom -- how?
* what categories?
* how do we show the impact of donations to donors? pictures, etc?

Painpoints: <br>
* sustainability (incentive to provide recurring donations)?
* disconnect between target demographic and complicated user onboarding process
    * need to verify usability of [Bloom](https://bloom.io)
* how do we measure or verify need
