# Brainstorming

Categories (food, water, shelter, etc.):
* Food/Water 
* Healthcare
    * Childcare
* Clothes (think of overarching category)

Crypto Components: <br>
* 0x portal for donating with crypto
* Bloom for managing list of recipients

Open Questions:<br>
* ranking users with Bloom -- how?
* what categories?
* how do we show the impact of donations to donors? pictures, etc?

Painpoints: <br>
* sustainability (incentive to provide recurring donations)?
* disconnect between target demographic and complicated user onboarding process
    * need to verify usability of [Bloom](https://bloom.io)
* how do we measure or verify need
