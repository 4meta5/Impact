The Trump budget had proposed cutting food stamps by
more than 25 percent over the next ten years and more or less abandoning the
notion that the country should provide some minimum level of nutrition to its
citizens. The Trump budget was just an opening bid and unlikely to become
policy, at least not right away, because Congress could always fight it. But it
signaled an intention and, perhaps, a shift in public attitude. (page 53)

The federal government makes the benefits available but then
leaves it to states to administer them. “Where you live in this country makes a
huge difference if you are poor,” says Concannon. “And it’s not just the
weather. You have states with these sixty- or seventy-page documents people
have to fill out to get benefits. Poor people are easy to wear down.” Georgia
was usually a problem. Texas, too. “If they ran any of their football teams the
way they run their food program, they’d fire the coach,” said Concannon. A
Wyoming legislator, proud of how badly he had gummed up the state’s
nutrition programs, told him, “We pride ourselves on doing the minimum
required by the federal government.” An Arizona congressman proposed that
the card used by people receiving food-stamp benefits be made prison orange,
conferring not just nutrition but shame. In 2016, after several counties in
North Carolina suffered severe flooding, the state tried to distribute federal
disaster-relief food-benefit cards on the day of the presidential election, to
give poor people a choice between eating and voting. In Kansas, Concannon
had explained to an executive who oversaw the state’s food-stamp program
how he had made it easier for people in Oregon who were going hungry to
access their program. “He said,” Jeez, if we did that we’d have more people
coming in the door.’ And I said,” Yeah, but isn’t that the idea?’” (page 55)
