# Conditional vs Unconditional Cash Transfers

A common critique of conditional cash transfers is that it inherently limited the autonomy of the recipient by dictating how they spend a donation. While some may argue that donations should have strings attached to ensure the funds are spent responsibly, others argue that this perspective perpetuates the cycle of poverty by assuming the recipient cannot manage their finances.

We believe that by opting for conditional purchases of goods required by recipients, we can enable the autonomy of recipients (in specifying which goods they prefer) while also increasing the confidence of donors that their donations will be used for the intended purpose.
