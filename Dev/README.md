Bloom Protocol is an end-to-end protocol for decentralized login, identity, and credit scoring. With Bloom Protocol, you can implement compliant financial systems without sacrificing user privacy or risking data breaches. You don’t have to take custody of a user’s personal data, or rely on a centralized system. The user holds the only keys to release their data and you can be sure the data they are sharing has been independently verified.
